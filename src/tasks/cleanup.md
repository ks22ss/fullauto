Repo hygiene sweep.

1. Find stale issues/PRs (>7 days no activity):
   - Add comment: "Friendly ping – any update on this? Otherwise happy to close."
   - Label "stale" if appropriate
2. Find old TODO/FIXME comments (>90 days):
   - Create issues for important ones
   - Or add comment on file if minor
3. Broken/outdated README/docs links → fix in small PR

Do not close anything automatically – always ask or create issue.
